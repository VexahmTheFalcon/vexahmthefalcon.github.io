      <h1>About This Project</h1>

      <p>
      This website publishes structured, independent comparisons of digital compliance and consent management tools commonly used by online publishers.
      </p>

      <p>
      The goal is to summarize publicly available vendor documentation in a clear, neutral, and accessible format for bloggers and website owners evaluating implementation options.
      </p>

      <p>
      This project is independently created and maintained by Deepan N Balaji.
